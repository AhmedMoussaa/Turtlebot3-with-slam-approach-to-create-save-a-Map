First will visit this site : https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#pc-setup
and do the steps there where you will install ROS1 , then install it's packages 

and after that will install turtlebot3 packages and configure it with your own network

after that will start with the gazebo simulation as you will install the simulation package 

https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#gazebo-simulation

and then launch the turtlebot3 world (i choose the waffle world)

and from the slam simulation you will run the slam node , and then teleoperation node 

once done you will save a map that you can run on RVIZ 

but you will face a problem where the Robot will be looking in white like this : https://prnt.sc/1fmpjq2

where the robot model is broken , in order to fix it 

1- go to files 
2- open catkin_ws  -> src ->turtlebot3_simulations -> turtlebot3_gazebo
3- open the launch files and serach for turtlebot3_word.launch
4- open the file and add an extra line at the bottom which is for <node>
 picture of the code : https://prnt.sc/1fmreyh

after doing those 4 steps , and once launghing Rviz and starting the Robot model , the robot will look normal now and can see all details

now you can create the map after doing those which will look similar to the simulation world (the waffle one)
